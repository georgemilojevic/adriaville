  "Adriaville about text1": "With the will to turn my passion for the Adriatic region into a profession, everything started. I myself am a native of Croatia and I feel very close to him.  Several times a year I visit my country of birth and reminisce about it. My family has been in the hospitality industry for a long time and I learned a lot from my relatives.  Since I have not only a weakness for beautiful houses and apartments, but also an attention to detail, the decision for my career path was easy and I followed the example of my family.  After a successful education in the hospitality industry, I have been gaining experience in this industry for over a decade.  My job also took me to Germany and Switzerland.  Through years of practice in the hotel sector, I know what it means to be a welcoming host.  I myself already successfully rented accommodation in Dalmatia. Later, I decided to start adriaville.com.
